- 👋 Hi, I’m @Brandi-R
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very, very basics of HTML, HTML5, and CSS on freeCodeCamp (independently)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on maybe nothing yet? I don't have a lot of skill :/
- I would appreciate any help and support from a community. Nobody in my life really understands why I am spending time on learning to code. :)
